# ideaFarmProject - Backend

## Idea Farm

Idea Farm is a department within Hanwha Life Insurance, South Korea's oldest and second largest life insurance company. 
Its primary objective is to develop new business ideas for the company appropos to the rapid changes that characterize our current society.

Modern problems require modern solutions. That is why the Idea Farm methodology is so drastically different from the rest of the company.  
Distancing itself from the traditional image of Korean companies -- hierarchial and old-fashioned -- Idea Farm prides itself in being free, open, and thereby innovative.
Here are a few of many practices that have been implemented: casual work attire, a free-seating policy, and flexible working hours. 

## The Project

Currently, Idea Farm uses the good old pen and paper to record when employees arrive at work and leave. This is then recorded manually into an excel file
which is then used to calculate whether the employee has fulfilled her minimum weekly work time of 40 hours. I am working in collaboration with an employee
to develop an app which will streamline this process. I have been asked to handle the backend of this project, the product of which can be found mostly within
`./api/index.js`

The `public` folder contains a quick REST API Tester that I created for, well, testing purposes. I did not update this after making significant changes to the api
upon receiving the required endpoints from my co-worker. Regardless, I realized that a service called Postman basically does just the testing that I needed.
